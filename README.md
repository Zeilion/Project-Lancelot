# Project-Lancelot
Lancelot Escape-game repository

My first game made with Python3.

"Lancelot enters the castle atop the Snow Python, armed with his precious storage bag and his freshly lit torch from the Beltane fires. 
He must find the statue of Saint Axerror, the masterpiece of Gide de Rome, known as the "eternal evil tyrant".

Fortunately, to help him in his quest, Merlin, his master, provided him a plan of the castle's halls and corridors. This plan will 
be very useful to him, given the enormity of the building, both in size and in the number of its rooms.

Before leaving, Merlin gave him the key to the front door of the castle and gave him a lot of advice, including that of keeping all the 
objects he finds during his quest: these will allow him to answer the questions and various puzzles that will not fail to pose the guards
posted in front of the doors inside the castle.

Merlin told his disciple that if he proceeds intelligently, his quest will be satisfied."
